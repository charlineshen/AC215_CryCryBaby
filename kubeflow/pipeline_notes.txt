Current Goal:
-- Show that pipeline ML triggers successfully. 

Current Step: 
Test the container in 
Change preprocessing container to operate *successfully* on vertexAI.

Next step:
Extend it into a single pipeline (I think)



Past steps:
Edit docker file to remove password var - no change.
change entire dockerfile - deadlock type warnings.
get docker build working directly for preprocessing inside deployment container
create *new* container and slowly add things to it.
Test build and push for preprocessing. Check it online for updates.



Reach goals:
Get preprocessing python into the both api-service container and preprocesing container, so update updates both.


Architecture:
ci-cd 

If /run- :
Build
Run Deploy App
deploy container: docker-entrypoint.sh
deploy container: deploy-app.sh (from docker run def)
deploy container: Ansible deploy images
deploy container: Ansible update k8s.

If /run-ml-pipeline: 

deploy container: docker-entrypoint.sh
deploy conatiner: run-ml-pipeline.sh (from docker run def)
deploy container: cli.py (from docker run def)
