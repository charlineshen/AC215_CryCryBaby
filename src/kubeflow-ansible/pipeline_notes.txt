Current Goal:
-- Ensure that the images are taken from the same place they are taken from elsin the deploy-k8s-cluster.

Current Step: 
Change preprocessing container to operate *successfully* on vertexAI.

Next step:
Extend it into a single pipeline (I think)



Past steps:
Edit docker file to remove password var - no change.
change entire dockerfile - deadlock type warnings.
get docker build working directly for preprocessing inside deployment container
create *new* container and slowly add things to it.
Test build and push for preprocessing. Check it online for updates.



Reach goals:
Get preprocessing python into the both api-service container and preprocesing container, so update updates both.
